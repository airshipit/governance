# Airship Contributing Guidelines

All Airship projects follow the contributing guidelines and
developement conventions described in the
[Develop Airship](https://airship-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/develop/index.html)
section of [Airship Docs](https://airship-docs.readthedocs.io/).

The Airship 2.x components, primarily
[airship/airshipctl](https://opendev.org/airship/airshipctl), have
additional
[Contributing Guidelines](https://opendev.org/airship/airshipctl/src/branch/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#user-content-contributing-guidelines)

Please, refer to those documents if you are participating in community
project development.

Thank you.
