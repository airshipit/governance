# Airship Core Principles

* [Community Principles](#community-principles)
* [Technical Principles](#technical-principles)

The Airship project follows several technical principles which guide what we build, and community
principles which guide how we build it.

## Community Principles

The Airship community is fully committed to the OpenStack Foundation
[Community Code of Conduct](https://www.openstack.org/legal/community-code-of-conduct). We are
a welcoming, respectful, and inclusive community, and believe treating one another in this way
is both the right thing to do and the best way to craft valuable software.

Airship is also committed to the [Four Opens](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Open) of software
development: Open Source, Open Design, Open Development, and Open Community.

## Technical Principles

The Airship project uses the following guiding principles in design and development, to ensure
that the software we author is valuable and solves the right problems.

* Airship is a declarative and automated toolset for the lifecycle management of
  open infrastructure.
* Airship is Repeatable, Predictable, Approachable, Flexible, Composable, and Reusable.
* Airship follows
  [cloud-native principles](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/DEFINITION.md)
  and uses standardized, open-source components, avoiding technology lock-in.
* Airship is small and focused, incorporating best-in-class open-source tooling and employing the
  principles above to integrate it in and make it valuable to operators. The Airship community
  prefers to enhance general-purpose projects, working within their communities, over crafting
  Airship-specific solutions.
